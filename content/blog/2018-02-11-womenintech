## BreizhCamp to support WomenInTech

If you have watched [BreizhCamp'18 video trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1-Gh0bMsUo) you might have noticed this flyer with a 
woman in bikini advertising "DosDev", a 10 time faster development environment. Doesn't look like a nice way to support WomenInTech, does it ?

Some notes about the context.

BreizhCamp do support WomenInTech for a while. The team and call for papers commitee include women, and we don't make any distinction about
this for selecting speakers. The fact there's a huge majority of white, male speakers just reflects the amount of proposal we receive and the low
diversity in our ecosystem.

In 2017 we invited two wemen as keynote speakers, as well as Antonin from the transexual, bisexual and Gay ligue. We wanted to make it clear
diversity in tech is not _just_ about women (even this is an obvious issue).

So what about this trailer video ?

## PCSoft

PCSoft is a French company, editor of "WinDev", which publish terrible advertisements using sexy women pictures, many of them being terribly 
embarassing. I let you [search google](https://www.google.fr/search?q=windev&source=lnms&tbm=isch) for an overview. This is something we 
denounce for a while. Here we tried another approach : as we're back for 30 years, we invented "DosDEV" development environment and used
a (way softer) illustration for our flyer, claiming the same "_10 time faster_" promise PCSoft does for his product. 

Marty to wonder "One made terrible things in 80's" is our way to make it clear such things should not take place in 2018 anymore. 

As a french company, PCSoft is not well known outside France, so this blog post to make it clear for international audience :P
