If you have watched [BreizhCamp'18 video trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1-Gh0bMsUo) you might have noticed this flyer with a 
woman in bikini advertising "DosDev". Doesn't look like a nice way to support #WomenInTech, does it ?

Some notes about the context.

## PCSoft

PCSoft is a French company, editor of "WinDev", which publish terrible advertisements using sexy women pictures, many of them being terribly 
embarassing. I let you [search google](https://www.google.fr/search?q=windev&source=lnms&tbm=isch) for an overview. This is something we 
denounce for a while. Here we tried another approach : as we're back for 30 years, we invented "DosDEV" development environment and used
this bikini illustration (which was used by PCSoft some years ago) for our flyer, claiming the same "_10 time faster_" promise PCSoft does for his product. 

Marty to wonder "One made terrible things in 80's" is our way to make it clear such things should not take place in 2018 anymore. 

By the way, Lena - who play the role of the "booth babe" for this fictive DosDev booth - is and Android developer and 
local Android Meetup organizer, so a real women in tech fully supporting our attempt to break such terrible habit to rely on 
sexy women pictures for advertisment. 

As a french company, PCSoft is not well known outside France, so this blog post to make it clear for international audience :P
